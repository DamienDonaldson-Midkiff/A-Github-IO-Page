# A-Github-IO-Page

I enjoy coding in the evenings and mornings. Usually when I'm problem-solving an issue I had earlier in the day or later in the day that carried over to the morning.
I normally code with a snack (smoothie, pizza, finger food (that's not that messy), etc.). And with my dogs lounging nearby.
I also watch shows or movies, particularly those two, and not other content-related videos like YouTube, Twitch, etc.
